# Minidox case

Simple case for [minidox](https://github.com/That-Canadian/MiniDox_PCB) keyboard, based on the great designs of [dotdash32](https://github.com/dotdash32/Cases/tree/master/Minidox) and optimized for 3d print.

## Elements

The case consist in two parts only: [bottom case](stl/bottom.stl) and [plate](stl/plate.stl).
Regarding screw holes, there are two sizes:
* 1/4" for side flaps
* 1/8" for bottom and plate union.
